# Interop test results

This repository renders the results of the OpenPGP test suite to https://ghpages.metacode.biz/interop/

OpenPGP implementers are invited to extend the `Dockerfile` and `config.json` to get their implementation rendered too!

The tests can also be built locally with the usual `docker build` and `docker run` combo.
The image exposes a simple webserver listening on port `8080`.
